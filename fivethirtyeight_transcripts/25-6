Want to work in a newsroom that combines reporting, writing, data analysis, computer science and a general sense of irreverence? FiveThirtyEight is hiring college students or recent graduates to work as paid interns in our New York office this spring in two positions:
Internships typically run from January to May, and interns can work up to 40 hours per week, but we can work around your class schedule. Both interns will work at the center of a world-class, collaborative newsroom and will have the opportunity to contribute bylined work to the site.
