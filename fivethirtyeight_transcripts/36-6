FiveThirtyEight is looking for an experienced reporter to join our team and cover the intersection of politics and technology. This beat will look at how tech affects politics and vice versa. The internet is rife with disinformation campaigns, election security hazards and targeted political ads. Likewise, Congress and the White House are threatening to more closely monitor and regulate the world of tech, often in radically different ways.
We’re looking for a reporter who can explore all of that and more. The ideal candidate will be someone who keeps a flashlight on them to explore the dark web, is literate in the upside and downside of algorithms and is experienced at finding larger, thematic stories in smaller, particular examples. An interest in the political dimensions of tech (and vice versa) is a must. This reporter will mix a savvy understanding of data – where to find it, what to do with it and how to interpret it – with traditional reporting skills to advance FiveThirtyEight’s mission: using empiricism to help make sense of the world.
