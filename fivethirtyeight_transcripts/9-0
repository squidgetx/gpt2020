Over the past year, FiveThirtyEight visual journalists have created hundreds of original charts and graphics. To mark the close of the year, we are continuing our tradition of collecting together a few dozen of our most creative (and most unusual) creations. There’s no particular order here, so don’t go looking for any deeper meaning. Click through any graphic to read the story that went with it.
























































You made it all the way here? We admire your commitment to great visual journalism! Check out our lists from 2018, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
