We are back with another round of our 2020 Democratic primary draft! Our politics podcast team didnâ€™t do so well in the previous episode, but this time around, the whole gang (Clare, Galen, Micah and Nate) is back and looking for redemption.
While the field of candidates is dwindling (slowly), we were still able to get through two rounds of picks (snake format, of course). Watch the video above to see who we think are the clear front-runners, who are the dark-horse candidates, who has no chance whatsoever, and which drafter picked Andrew Yang.
