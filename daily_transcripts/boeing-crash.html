Before we start today, I’d like to speak directly to the families of the victims who are here with us. On behalf of myself and the Boeing company we are sorry, deeply and truly sorry. As a husband and father myself, I’m heartbroken by your losses. I think about you and your loved ones every day. And I know our entire Boeing team does, as well. I know that probably doesn’t offer much comfort and healing at this point. But I want you to know that we carry those memories with us every day.
