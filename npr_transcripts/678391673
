SCOTT DETROW, HOST: 
Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. Today we are doing something a little bit different, and we are going to address the one thing that all of you, our listeners, could not let go of this year. And we will explain. I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I cover the White House.
MILES PARKS, BYLINE: I'm Miles Parks. I'm a political reporter.
DETROW: We've got a very special guest here today, Stephen Thompson from NPR Music. How's it going?
STEPHEN THOMPSON, BYLINE: It is great. I'm so excited and honored to be here. I love this podcast.
DETROW: I've got to say, this is kind of trippy because you are a regular on POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR, and we basically stole your format.
(LAUGHTER)
THOMPSON: You stole it and then perfected it.
DETROW: But now you're here, so it's like the full...
THOMPSON: That's right.
DETROW: ...Blend of the two podcasts.
THOMPSON: That's right, coming home...
RASCOE: A full-circle moment.
DETROW: So Stephen, we are here because of one very important thing. Of all the things we said in all the podcasts this year, which is a lot, there was one thing that our listeners couldn't let go. We got the most angry response on Twitter, in email, on the street, everywhere. And it is something that Tim Mak said on August 23. Let's take a listen to that and go from there.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)
TIM MAK: Well, here's what I kind of wanted to go on a mini-rant on.
DETROW: OK.
MAK: And it was, like, you can't find good political music.
DETROW: Does anyone agree with Tim? No offense to Tim, but is there good political music, or do people just try too hard, and it leads to bad music?
RASCOE: No, absolutely. There are great political songs. And there are songs, political songs, that kind of last throughout the decades - right? - like "What's Going On" by Marvin Gaye.
PARKS: I will say that I'm a big believer in the songs that don't hit it so hard on the head. Like, if the song is a straight - ahead political song, I'm probably listening one time so I know what people are talking about when they're angry tweeting about it. But then other than that, I'm not going back and listening to it while I'm, like, working out or something like that. I feel like a little tinge of politics is kind of where my happy medium is.
DETROW: OK. So Stephen, ingredients for a good political song?
THOMPSON: Well, Scott, first of all, I appreciate the preamble of saying, does anyone agree with Tim, after you set up that people have been, like, whipping eggs at you on the street for months about it.
DETROW: I want to say I don't think it's surprising that, of all the people who could garner this kind of response, it is, like, a very Tim Mak thing to just say something that controversial and then just let it hang and just wait for the response.
RASCOE: And poor Tim isn't here to defend himself.
(LAUGHTER)
RASCOE: He's responded to this, I think.
DETROW: We should probably let him know we're doing this podcast before it publishes.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: But Stephen, I assume you disagree.
THOMPSON: I do disagree. I mean, first of all, as Ayesha said, you have absolutely unimpeachable, classic songs that are themselves protest songs. To say there is no good protest music is silly. At the same time, if I can defend slightly what Tim said, I do think it has gotten harder to make a good protest song. We are now in a world, first of all, where a lot more people are making music than used to make music. You don't necessarily have this kind of monoculture, you know, happening. Everything is so stratified.
And so when you have a musician who's trying to explicitly comment on a major piece of news or whatever, as you said, Miles, it's so on-the-nose that it can be hard to really latch into it. So my favorite political music is either somewhat vague in its intentions, where it works as a jam but also as a commentary, or it takes something really, really big and makes it smaller and more personal.
RASCOE: If you have a bigger issue that you're talking about - like, I was just thinking about, like, Jay-Z, "99 Problems."
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "99 PROBLEMS")
JAY-Z: (Rapping) If you having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems, but a b**** ain't one.
RASCOE: He's talking about get pulled over by the police. That's, like, a universal - well, not universal.
(LAUGHTER)
RASCOE: But what I mean is it is an overarching issue, especially for people of color, especially for black people. And it is an experience that just resonates. So him being able to talk about that and to give you the kind of visual of it - and even some of the lines, like, you know, I'm not going to let you illegally search my car - you think about that, like, yeah. I'm not going to let you look in my trunk. Like, I'm going to just say no. Like, he's giving you legal advice.
PARKS: Right, and I think that's what makes that a great song...
RASCOE: Yes.
PARKS: ...Is it's not a song - the specificity is what makes it a great song. I didn't realize really what that song was about until I listened to it a couple of different times. I mean, I'm...
DETROW: Getting back to it not being a universal problem.
(LAUGHTER)
PARKS: No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I understand what it was about. I was thinking it's a story. I mean...
RASCOE: Of his story.
PARKS: His story, right. And I'm so into that scene, and I can see when he said - what does he say?
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "99 PROBLEMS")
JAY-Z: (Rapping) Am I under arrest or should I guess some more? Well, you was doing 55 in a 54. License and registration and step out of the car. Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.
RASCOE: Yeah, you're doing 55 in a 54...
DETROW: Right, yeah.
RASCOE: ...And all of these things. (Laughter). You know, but the way that he puts that, I mean, when you look at the hook - I got 99 problems but a - ain't one...
DETROW: Right.
RASCOE: ...You don't realize that it's going to be this very important song.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "99 PROBLEMS")
JAY-Z: (Rapping) If you having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son. I've got 99 problems but a b**** ain't one. Hit me.
THOMPSON: One thing that I wanted to throw in when we talk about specificity - there were several songs that jump out at me - a song by Dessa called "Fire Drills," a song by Courtney Barnett called "Nameless, Faceless" - that are about being a woman trying to make your way in the world and not being able to walk at night and feel safe, not being able to go online and feel safe.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "FIRE DRILLS")
DESSA: (Rapping) As a woman, always something left to take, so you shouldn't try to stay too late or talk to strangers, look too long, go too far out of range 'cause angels can't watch everybody all the time. Stay close, hems low, safe inside. The formula works if you can live it, but it works by putting half the world off-limits.
THOMPSON: These are very powerful, like, hard-edged, viscerally exciting songs that are still about this moment, but they're about every moment in the history of women in America and the world.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "NAMELESS, FACELESS")
COURTNEY BARNETT: (Singing) I want to walk through the park in the dark. Men are scared that women will laugh at them. I want to walk through the park in the dark. Women are scared that men will kill them.
THOMPSON: And so they manage to be political songs. They're not necessarily pieces of political advocacy so much as, this is my experience. Either hook into this shared experience or view this experience as an outsider and understand what I'm going through and what women are going through.
DETROW: So as the veteran of talking about pop culture here in Studio 44 that you are, you just provided us the perfect segue (laughter)...
THOMPSON: (Laughter).
DETROW: ...To get to the next thing that we wanted to talk about, and that is it's the end of the year. Everybody's doing year-end lists. What - Stephen, what, for you, was the best political song of 2018?
THOMPSON: Oh, man.
DETROW: (Laughter).
THOMPSON: This is tough. I mean, I've named a bunch that I really love. There are a few other things that I wanted to mention. I think the - pretty much the entire Janelle Monae record "Dirty Computer" manages to tap into something that I've been thinking a lot about protest music in 2018 - that a lot of what I guess qualifies as protest music is really statements of identity.
By existing in the world in this very bold way, that is in and of itself a political statement. You had that Beyonce and Jay-Z record, "Everything Is Love." You watch that video where they're performing in the Louvre. That is very much about, like, we are taking up this place that is not ordinarily considered welcoming to us, and we are in it.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "APES**T")
BEYONCE: (Singing) Jumping off the stage, oh.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) Jumping, jumping, hey, hey.
BEYONCE: (Singing) Crowd better savor.
THOMPSON: And so Janelle Monae's record kind of falls into that same thing. It is this statement of blackness, of queerness, of womanhood that also sounds like Prince.
RASCOE: Well, and we talked a lot about this in the POLITICS PODCAST, that Beyonce album. And, you know, I kind of said, oh, this was, like, a fun, happy album. And someone did write to me and was like, no...
THOMPSON: You start to pick it apart.
RASCOE: ...This has very deep meanings. And I'm - and I agree because everything that Beyonce does - and even Jay-Z, at this point - is very intentional. And I think putting themselves in the Louvre and doing all of those things is to say a lot of culture has been taken from black people. And this is our way of saying we are taking ownership of something that has traditionally been more European.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "APES**T")
BEYONCE: (Singing) I can't believe we made it.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) This is what we made, made.
BEYONCE: (Singing) This is what we're thankful.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) This is what we thank, thank.
BEYONCE: (Singing) I can't believe we made it.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) This a different angle.
BEYONCE: (Singing) Have you ever seen the crowd going ape? Rah (ph). Give me my check.
DETROW: I do think in that song specifically too, even when you get away from the lyrics, I think just the sound of Beyonce's voice in that record...
RASCOE: Yeah.
DETROW: ...There is a sense of breaking out that - you listen to old Beyonce records, you - it is not that same sense of tension.
THOMPSON: There's a line in a song on that record called "Boss" where Beyonce sings, my great-great-grandchildren already rich. That's a lot of brown children on your Forbes list. And on one hand, like, that's a great brag.
RASCOE: Yeah.
THOMPSON: But on another, it's like, look. Look where we are. Look where we've been. Look where we're going.
DETROW: All right. So Stephen, you admit it. You are a man of long windup...
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: ...And that's great.
(LAUGHTER)
THOMPSON: I could've gone longer. Tunde Olaniran made a great record this year. Anyway, go ahead.
DETROW: You mentioned a lot of great music. But was there one in the end that really rises to the top that you feel like, this is definitively - maybe definitive is too strong. But if you had to pick one, what is it?
THOMPSON: I could never be definitive, but I think Childish Gambino, the song "This Is America."
DETROW: Yeah.
THOMPSON: Which kind of dropped out of nowhere a little bit. He was on "Saturday Night Live" and performing. And then all of a sudden, he debuts this song, "This Is America."
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THIS IS AMERICA")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go away.
PARKS: And for me, I feel like one of the downsides of pop culture shifting to the internet is that there are few, like, real-time surprises anymore.
DETROW: Right.
PARKS: And this was the exception for that. Like, I saw this buzz about this video, but I didn't quite know why. So I pretty quickly was watching the video in real time, and I had that same shocking moment that somebody else had when this video just takes a turn.
THOMPSON: Well, it's a great example. You're talking about, you know, the internet makes it hard for surprises to happen, but Childish Gambino used the internet to really hammer home the surprise. He appeared on "Saturday Night Live," performed the song - wow - and then immediately released the video. And he's dancing. He's shirtless. He's just kind of writhing through (laughter) these different scenes, and he actually pulls out a gun and shoots someone.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THIS IS AMERICA")
CHILDISH GAMBINO: (Rapping) This is America. Don't catch you slipping up. Don't catch you slipping up.
THOMPSON: That person is unceremoniously dragged away like that person meant nothing. And the gun is, like, cushioned and, like, carried away in this very delicate fashion. And you're left - not only in the song, but in the video - to really parse out some very strong meanings.
DETROW: One of my favorite responses to this - and I totally forget who said it on Twitter, but they said, Donald Glover is doing what Kanye thinks he's doing in terms of a political message. So let's actually just take a step back for the six people who haven't watched this video who are listening. What was the overarching political message of this song and this video?
RASCOE: To me, the political message seemed to be about how violence is a part of America and how certain people in America can be disposable. When he - when they - he takes the gun and he shoots the choir, that obviously seems to be a message about what happened in Charleston and how there - so many shootings can happen, they run together. And in America, you had all of these people killed in church, and we've just moved on.
PARKS: Till the next church shooting...
RASCOE: Till the next shooting...
PARKS: ...Then we move on four days later.
RASCOE: And to the school shooting, and you just - and it all blurs together.
PARKS: Yeah.
THOMPSON: It is a song and a video about desensitization, but it expects you to be able to desensitize yourself in order to consume it. So it is this very powerful statement that is not meant to be easy to watch.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THIS IS AMERICA")
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Get your money, black man.
CHILDISH GAMBINO: (Singing) Black man.
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Get your money, black man.
CHILDISH GAMBINO: (Singing) Black man.
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Get your money, black man.
CHILDISH GAMBINO: (Singing) Black man.
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Get your money, black man.
CHILDISH GAMBINO: (Singing) Black man.
UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Black man.
RASCOE: And it ends with him running, seemingly for his life, in total fear.
PARKS: Yeah.
RASCOE: Like, that image of him just running for his life is kind of like this idea that you can't slip up, and that if you do, the consequences are dire.
THOMPSON: Absolutely. And I think getting back a little bit to what Scott said in the beginning, part of what makes this, to me, the political song of the year is that it was experienced collectively in ways that so many of - I mean, I can list - I have listed a whole bunch of really, really great songs that invoke politics, but they weren't experienced by, like, everyone in your office at the same time over the same weekend...
DETROW: Yeah.
THOMPSON: ...On the same social media where all of a sudden, like, everybody's experiencing the same thing and discussing it. We don't get very many opportunities to do that as the culture becomes more and more and more diffuse.
DETROW: All right, so Childish Gambino, "This Is America." All right. So Stephen, at the end of each of our Thursday shows, we talk about what we can't let go. So taking the politics out of it, what's the music you can't let go of this year?
THOMPSON: For me, a couple of the best albums of the year were made by women who were pushing the boundaries of what people consider country music. I think the Kacey Musgraves album "Golden Hour" is pretty widely accepted as one of the albums of the year.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "OH, WHAT A WORLD")
KACEY MUSGRAVES: (Singing) Oh, what a world. I don't want to leave. There's all kinds of magic. It's hard to believe. Oh, what a world.
THOMPSON: It's not just a country record. It is - it's kind of a soft pop record with even, like, little elements of disco to it almost.
DETROW: Oh, it's got some grooves.
THOMPSON: But also, a lot of it is just very candlelit and soft and sweet. That record is just one of those, you know, at night in your house with the lights turned down...
RASCOE: (Laughter).
THOMPSON: ...(Laughter) You know, kind of albums of reflection and beauty. And I'm so glad that it's been so widely embraced.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "OH, WHAT A WORLD")
MUSGRAVES: (Singing) Oh, what a world. Don't want to leave. All kinds of magic all around us, it's hard to believe. Thank God...
DETROW: Well, Stephen, thanks so much for coming to hang out with us.
THOMPSON: Thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here.
DETROW: Stephen, as you could tell, has a lot more thoughts on music in general...
THOMPSON: (Laughter).
RASCOE: Yes.
DETROW: ...Which you can read at NPR Music's website. And he's also on the Pop Culture Happy Hour podcast which, if you ever need a break from politics, is a great podcast to listen to, and I'm still really hoping to be on it the next time there's a big superhero movie.
THOMPSON: Oh, all right. Noted.
DETROW: Know anybody...
THOMPSON: Noted, Scott Detrow.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: All right. Stephen, thanks a lot.
THOMPSON: Thank you.
DETROW: All right. We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and talk about our favorite songs of the year without the politics.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "OH, WHAT A WORLD")
MUSGRAVES: (Singing) And then there is you.
DETROW: All right. We'll be right back.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
DETROW: And we are back. And Stephen is gone, but now Danielle Kurtzleben's here. Hey, Danielle.
DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.
DETROW: And I know you listen to a lot of music because you always have your headphones in.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: But I can never see your headphones, so I'm always like, hey, Danielle. And then there's a 10-second pause.
KURTZLEBEN: (Laughter).
DETROW: And then I realize, oh, she has headphones in again. This happens every day, and I've never picked up on it.
KURTZLEBEN: Oh, well...
DETROW: Which all goes to say I feel like you have a lot to contribute here (laughter).
KURTZLEBEN: I like to think so.
DETROW: OK. So what we're going to do here is kind of throw politics off the side of the ship and just talk about our favorite songs from the year, what we listened to, whether we were traveling to stories or sitting at our desk or just driving around - songs of the year.
So Danielle, you're listening to music all day. I know this - or you just don't want to talk to me, which is cool.
(LAUGHTER)
KURTZLEBEN: You know, headphones do give you plausible deniability where if someone is like, hey, Danielle, I'm like, I don't want to talk to you. I just kind of shrug it off.
PARKS: I think that's the NPR way, really. Like, 80% of this building is just kind of, like, nodding along.
KURTZLEBEN: But I've never done that to you, Scott.
DETROW: OK.
KURTZLEBEN: Yes.
DETROW: We can just stick with that premise for my feelings.
KURTZLEBEN: But at any rate...
DETROW: OK. Of all the songs you're listening to...
KURTZLEBEN: Well, to set this up - you guys may know this; our listeners probably do not - but tucked away in the bowels of the first floor of NPR, there is a grand piano. It's awesome because it is over in this corner. You can't even see that anybody is playing it from the outside. And so when I am sick of writing or - I don't know if this happens to you guys. You're working on a story. It's not going well. You actually just hate it. You feel like you're not doing a good job on it. Maybe, I don't know. I've heard this happens.
DETROW: This is when I go eat food, but it sounds like you're more productive.
KURTZLEBEN: I go play piano.
RASCOE: Wow.
KURTZLEBEN: And this year, you know, in the middle of a midterm year, there was a lot of stuff going on. I had a lot of capital M moments where I was just like, all right. Screw this. Like, let's go pound on something.
(SOUNDBITE OF FRANZ LISZT'S "UN SOSPIRO")
KURTZLEBEN: My song is "Un Sospiro" by Franz Liszt. You don't have to know it. It's no big deal. But it's - it also matches this year. It's big, it's melodramatic, but it's also calming at the same time. It's kind of perfect.
(SOUNDBITE OF FRANZ LISZT'S "UN SOSPIRO")
KURTZLEBEN: I like how you're all entranced.
RASCOE: Yeah.
KURTZLEBEN: This is great.
RASCOE: I feel more...
DETROW: And you can play this?
RASCOE: Yeah.
KURTZLEBEN: I want - I'm not as good as this person at all.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: I just have no musical ability, so I'm...
RASCOE: Yeah, I'm...
DETROW: ...Always so impressed when people can.
KURTZLEBEN: I - I've been playing since I was a kid. I was very small.
RASCOE: Wow.
KURTZLEBEN: But - so - but this is one of the pieces I go down and plunk out when I am really frustrated.
(SOUNDBITE OF FRANZ LISZT'S "UN SOSPIRO")
PARKS: I will say this is, like, the calmest I have felt in literal weeks - is listening to this song.
KURTZLEBEN: Well, now you know why I'm so anxiety-free around the office.
(LAUGHTER)
KURTZLEBEN: So anxiety-free.
RASCOE: I feel so sophisticated just listening to this.
KURTZLEBEN: I thought I would bring the class today, you guys.
RASCOE: You brought class.
DETROW: This is the most old-school public radio that the podcast has ever been.
KURTZLEBEN: You know, my second choice was "War Pigs" by Sabbath, but I figured, let's go with this. This is...
RASCOE: This is calming. This is - this elevates.
KURTZLEBEN: Yes.
RASCOE: This elevates, I think.
DETROW: Miles, I'm going to ask you to share your song next.
(LAUGHTER)
KURTZLEBEN: Oh, God.
DETROW: You're listening to classical music on the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.
KURTZLEBEN: Oh, my God.
(LAUGHTER)
PARKS: Mine is going to be a little different.
DETROW: OK, so let's have a buffer.
PARKS: I'm just - let's everyone take a deep breath.
DETROW: OK.
PARKS: OK. Pivot, pivot. OK.
RASCOE: All right.
PARKS: And so I want to put you in my mindset when I discovered this artist. This is going to be an artist named Burna Boy, who is a Nigerian Afro-fusion singer-songwriter. I found this artist earlier this summer coming back from two softball victories...
DETROW: Yeah.
PARKS: ...For the NPR softball team.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: Tell us...
PARKS: We...
DETROW: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
KURTZLEBEN: Wait. Wait. Was this just an excuse?
(LAUGHTER)
PARKS: No, no, no, no, no.
DETROW: Are you talking about the regular season champion?
PARKS: You have to listen to me.
KURTZLEBEN: All right. All right. All right. All right.
PARKS: We heard about piano. You have to hear about softball.
KURTZLEBEN: Yes.
PARKS: That's the deal.
KURTZLEBEN: Get to hear about softball.
PARKS: OK. So - couple victories in the rearview mirror. We're driving, windows down, from the suburbs of Maryland back into D.C., going a sweet 75 mph - OK...
KURTZLEBEN: So breaking the law.
PARKS: ...And drinking Gatorades - possibly, potentially. And this is just celebration music. It just sounds like glory to me.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SEKKLE DOWN")
BURNA BOY: (Singing) Hey, gal. Let me tell you wahgwan. Let me flow in, out your ear like the River Jordan. Understand you want me, but you say you have a man.
DETROW: I wish I could describe...
KURTZLEBEN: OK, I'm with you.
DETROW: ...What Miles is doing right now.
RASCOE: This is a - yeah, this is a groove.
KURTZLEBEN: Yes.
RASCOE: This - OK. OK.
KURTZLEBEN: I can get behind this, yeah.
RASCOE: OK.
PARKS: Wait till the chorus comes in. It's going to get even better.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SEKKLE DOWN")
BURNA BOY: (Singing) Sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle down pon (ph) me. Too many different type of gal inna (ph) the party.
PARKS: This entire album, which is called "Outside," basically just sounds like this at different tempos, oh, for 45 straight minutes, and it is my happy place. It is for parties. It is for working out. It is for hanging out.
KURTZLEBEN: (Laughter).
PARKS: It is for doing all of the happy things in your life. It just puts a smile on my face.
KURTZLEBEN: Perfect.
RASCOE: And so what type of dancing do you - I've seen a little bit in the chair, but...
PARKS: It's not good. It's not good.
RASCOE: ...Is it - are you kind of winding it up? Are you...
PARKS: OK. So for the listeners out there, I...
(LAUGHTER)
KURTZLEBEN: He's dancing in a car, first of all.
PARKS: All right. For the listeners out there to get a visual...
DETROW: It was a little herky-jerky.
PARKS: I went...
DETROW: Let's be honest.
PARKS: I went to Europe this summer and got the nickname on this trip of Cornstalk.
(LAUGHTER)
PARKS: But just - for the listeners to understand that my body type - I just want you to know that's basically what is happening here. We've got shoulders. We've got a little bit of...
RASCOE: You got a little shimmy.
PARKS: We've got some hip. We've got some shimmy.
RASCOE: Got a little shimmy.
PARKS: You guys were shimmying, too. I don't know why it's all about my shimmy.
RASCOE: I was - I cannot dance. I cannot dance...
KURTZLEBEN: I was doing the awkward bounce.
RASCOE: ...So I'm not - I can do a lot of chair dancing, but I cannot dance. So I just wanted to know whether you also bring in the moves...
KURTZLEBEN: Right.
RASCOE: ...'Cause this makes you want to move.
PARKS: I've been known to bring in the moves if that - that's - I'll leave it at that, OK?
DETROW: All right. Thank you for sharing not only that, but also your dance moves with us, Miles. So Ayesha, Danielle's happy place is playing piano. Miles' happy place is playing weekend softball on the NPR softball team. What is your song, and do you have a happy place that goes with it?
RASCOE: Well, I don't know if it's really a happy place, but I was on maternity leave at the beginning of this year. I got to, you know, have all these babies. But I had a baby last year. And so I would be, like, driving to nursery school. And I would be in the van, just dropped my son off. And I would just be cranking this.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BLIND")
TAMAR BRAXTON: (Singing) I'd rather go blind, blind, blind than to see you with her...
RASCOE: The music I listen to is not current. But this came out in 2017, and it combines some of my loves - so ratchet reality TV and, like, classic R&B. So it is from Tamar Braxton...
DETROW: OK.
RASCOE: ...The sister of Toni Braxton.
KURTZLEBEN: Oh, OK.
RASCOE: "Braxton Family Values" - there was "Tamar & Vince." These are shows on WE tv. And she had an album called "The Bluebird Of Happiness" that came out late 2017. But I really discovered it 2018. And she has this song called "Blind." And I would be singing kind of at the top of my lungs.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BLIND")
BRAXTON: (Singing) I've been praying, wishing, hoping that you'd notice me. But now you're surrounded by new company. I play it cool, but the truth is that's a lie. I'd rather go blind, blind, blind than to see you with her...
RASCOE: I love songs about love that is just crazy. When you love somebody so much that if they leave, you'd rather just go blind, you crazy. But I like that.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: Wait. So can you tie this back into ratchet reality TV? I'm - so...
RASCOE: Because Tamar is on reality TV. She got her start. There was "Braxton Family Values" with Toni Braxton and her sisters. And Tamar wanted to be a singer like Toni Braxton.
DETROW: I see.
RASCOE: But she'd been in the background. And so that reality TV show helped launch her career.
DETROW: OK.
RASCOE: And - yes.
DETROW: And now she's doing it.
RASCOE: And now she's doing it.
DETROW: And is she still on TV?
RASCOE: She's still - well, kind of, sort of. She had some issues with it. Like, her and her husband had a thing and - but now they going through a divorce. So it's like a whole thing. So - but it's a lot.
DETROW: OK. Well, she's going to have a lot more to sing about, is what you're saying.
RASCOE: She'll have a lot more to sing about.
KURTZLEBEN: Oh, yeah.
RASCOE: It's a lot. It's a lot going on with Tamar...
DETROW: (Laughter).
RASCOE: ...But I wish her the best.
KURTZLEBEN: Detrow.
DETROW: Yes.
KURTZLEBEN: Let's hear yours. What is your 2018 song?
DETROW: So I think, actually, this is building on several of the trends that Ayesha put out. I had one of those moments where Spotify gives you the top songs that you listened to all year where I clicked on it, and I was like, yeah, my life's a lot different than it was at the beginning of the year, based on this list. And so we had a son earlier this year. And when I put him to sleep at night - which has been a process, but you know (laughter)...
RASCOE: Yes.
DETROW: I found over the time that I began curating a go-to-sleep music playlist that sounded suspiciously like a middle school dance...
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: ...For people my age. There is lot of '90s slows jams, a lot of K-Ci & JoJo...
RASCOE: Oh, yeah.
KURTZLEBEN: Oh, my God.
DETROW: ...A lot of Boyz II Men...
RASCOE: Oh, that's - that is good.
DETROW: ...A lot of Mariah Carey.
RASCOE: Yes.
DETROW: And I found - I was like, wow, the swaying back and forth...
KURTZLEBEN: Right.
DETROW: ...Kind of mirrors the awkward dancing of when you actually did try to dance with someone else, which was a rare occurrence...
RASCOE: In middle school, yeah.
DETROW: ...In the Scott Detrow middle school dance experience.
KURTZLEBEN: (Laughter).
DETROW: But...
PARKS: This is some epic parallelism right now, yeah.
DETROW: So of all these '90s slow songs, though, what has risen to the top as his favorite to fall asleep to - scientifically tested - but also my favorite to listen to is a lot of slow, early '90s Michael Jackson.
RASCOE: Oh, OK.
DETROW: Particularly, No. 1 song of the year for me would be "Man In The Mirror."
RASCOE: Oh, yeah.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MAN IN THE MIRROR")
MICHAEL JACKSON: (Singing) Going to make a change for once in my life. It's going to feel real good, going to make a difference, going to make it right.
RASCOE: But that's not that slow. That gets a little fast.
KURTZLEBEN: Your son has taste.
DETROW: But it's...
RASCOE: But that's a great song.
DETROW: It's a great song. And it's a great song 'cause I actually have this early memory of - and this makes me sound really old now - but my dad got me, like, the 45s when this came out. So I listened to a 45 record of this song in my basement over and over when I was little. And I just liked it. So it's just very nice to, at the end of the day - even when he's not falling asleep - to just, like, hang out in a dark room - my son and listen to some Michael Jackson.
RASCOE: And it's all about personal responsibility. You got to start with the man in the mirror.
KURTZLEBEN: Look at yourself, make a change.
DETROW: That's right.
KURTZLEBEN: Cause, effect.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MAN IN THE MIRROR")
JACKSON: (Singing) I'm starting with the man in the mirror. I'm asking him to change his ways. And no message could have been any clearer. If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, then make a change.
DETROW: And there was this, like, nice moment of - we had just flown on a plane, and we were in the cab coming home. And he just lost his mind. He was good on the plane, but he lost his mind in the cab. And I was like, let's try this. So I just started playing this. And, like, cause association, he was...
RASCOE: And he went down to sleep.
DETROW: ...Snoring in the car in, like, 20 seconds.
RASCOE: It's a signal.
PARKS: Is there...
DETROW: And I was like, oh, my God. It worked.
(LAUGHTER)
KURTZLEBEN: For Scott Detrow.
DETROW: All right. So now you know a lot more about all of us than you did before.
RASCOE: Yes.
DETROW: This was fun, though. And we're thinking about doing this. So why don't you send us an email of your favorite songs of the year at NPRpolitics@npr.org, or you can tweet us @NPRpolitics. And we'll try to put together a Spotify playlist or something of all of the favorite songs of the year from our listeners. That is all for today, though. As much as talking about music can make you forget about it, news still does happen all the time. And when there's news, we will be back in your feeds covering the latest things happening.
I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress.
KURTZLEBEN: I'm Danielle Kurtzleben, political reporter.
RASCOE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I cover the White House.
PARKS: I'm Miles Parks. I cover voting.
DETROW: Thank you for listening to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.
