TAMARA KEITH, HOST: 
Hey there. It's Tamara Keith.
ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: And hey, I'm Asma Khalid.
SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: And I'm Scott Detrow. You guys are in D.C. I'm in Las Vegas, where Joe Biden is about to begin a campaign rally. Of course, the 2020 presidential campaign is well underway. But now suddenly, there's another big news story happening.
KEITH: That's right - impeachment.
KHALID: And so it seemed like it made sense to turn what we're already doing - podcasts that come to you whenever there's breaking news - into an official daily podcast.
DETROW: That's right. Every weekday, we will be in your podcast feed, telling you what you need to know and why it matters.
KEITH: In 2016, there were moments that we will always remember covering the biggest story of our time.
KHALID: And what I loved about the podcast and what we're going to do this time is be there and take you with us as this first draft of history is being written, whether that means New Hampshire, the Iowa caucuses or the convention floors.
KEITH: Like, literally sitting on cold, cement floors.
DETROW: Some of my favorite podcast episodes are where I'm doing what I'm doing right now. And it's just finding the quietest corner of a campaign rally that I can to connect and talk about what's happening out throughout the country.
KHALID: And are you wearing a jacket over your head for some good sound?
KEITH: (Laughter).
DETROW: I will say it's a little too hot right now for - in Las Vegas for the jacket that I normally have draped over my head in those settings. But winter's going to be here soon, and the jacket will certainly be over the hat.
KEITH: So, Scott, whether you are in Nevada or, Asma, you are at a campaign event in New Hampshire or I'm in the tiny basement booth of the White House, we are going to be there with you, our NPR POLITICS PODCAST listeners.
DETROW: There is a lot to keep track of. And we're going to do it for you.
KHALID: So check out your podcast feed later today. We will be there with a new episode, like we will every single weekday.
