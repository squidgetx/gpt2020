RUSH: By the way, the president signed this morning the new USMCA, United States–Mexico–Canada Trade Agreement getting rid of NAFTA. This is a big deal, as he said. I mean, this is one of the primary reasons that he ran. He and Bob Lighthizer and Pence came under great praise for getting this done.
It is a huge deal, and it’s just more illustration the president’s getting up every day and doing his job in the midst of all of this.
