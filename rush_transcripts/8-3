RUSH: (laughing) Look at this, folks! Look! New York Post headline: “Hillary Clinton Admits She Feels an Urge to Run Against Trump Again.” Mrs. Clinton, are you sure it just isn’t diarrhea? Maybe constipation?

She admits she feels an urge to run against Trump again, because she thinks that she can win this time. It’s what I mean. These people are deluded, folks. They are so absent common sense, it’s remarkable.
